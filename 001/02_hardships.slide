          Why aren't you on vim today?

          - Never had the opportunity
          - It's just too scary
          - There's too much missing that I haven't figured
            out how to do effectively (ctags, fuzzy file search,
            formatters, test runners, etc)
          - I'm too slow at vim to make the jump
